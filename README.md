# quteFF

* Custom userChrome.css that makes Firefox looks as close as possible to Qutebrowser.
* This is meant to be used with the [Vimium-ff](https://github.com/philc/vimium/) add-on.
* Forked from https://github.com/IanLeCorbeau/hawtbrowser/

## Usage
* Clone the repo.    

* In Firefox, go to _about:config_, search for _toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets_ and toggle it to __true__.

* Next go to _about:support_, and under "_Application Basics_", go to "_Profile Directory_" to find which profile you're using. You can either open the dir from the browser, of use the path to open yourself in your file manager.

* Copy the _chrome_ directory into your profile's directory.

* Install the Vimium-ff add-on.    

* Restart Firefox.
